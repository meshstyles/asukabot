# ASUKA Bot
Asuka bot was created to learn the basics of Discord.js simple things like responses and role management. And what better way is there to do this than with a little bit of fun. So all of the commands are basically useless besides the lfg feature which I actually took from meety bot.

Just be warned some of the commands can be perceived as offensive but aren't meant as such so please be warned and don't read any further
